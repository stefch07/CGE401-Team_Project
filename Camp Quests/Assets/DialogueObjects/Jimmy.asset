  dialogue:
  - "Well, hello there! You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve met in a while! [Press
    Spacebar to Advance Dialogue]"
  - "Gosh, It\u2019s exciting to get to see someone after so long on the road. Name\u2019s
    Jimmy!"
  - Care for a story?
  - "I\u2019ve had this great story lined up for the next person I found, and that\u2019ll
    be you!"
  - On a night like this? A ghost story sounds right...
  - So ya see, around these parts they say that a group encountered a ghost here
    a few decades back.
  - That group got caught up in a bad rainstorm and accidentally walked into this
    haunted cabin, see.
  - "They say that the cabin would only ever show up on nights with heavy rain\u2026
    and well, let\u2019s just say that group wound up pretty unlucky that night."
  - '[Jimmy leans in closer, lowering his voice to a whisper]'
  - Now, they say that the hikers huddled together in that old cabin, shivering cold
    and soaked to the bone.
  - "But what really spooked them was that they started hearing noises\u2026"
  - Footsteps creaking on the floor above, even though the whole cabin had been empty
    when they got there.
  - One of those unlucky few, probably trying to be brave or something, decided to
    go upstairs to check it out.
  - "As he got upstairs he saw a door, and the poor fella decided to walk through
    said door. No sooner had he gotten through that door than\u2026"
  - SLAM!
  - The door closed, locking that poor guy in.
  - "Now the others had been thrown into a panic trying to open the door, trying
    to free their buddy. But it all got quiet after a while\u2026"
  - 'The storm stopped, and those hikers sat there waiting for something to happen. '
  - Silence. The door at the top of the stairs finally opened, but their friend was
    gone.
  - "No sign of the guy, nothin\u2019 except his soaked boots left by the window
    in the room, as if he\u2019d stepped out into the rain. "
  - They never saw the guy again, and folks around here say that if ya look real
    close on stormy nights...
  - "...you might just see him wanderin\u2019 through the woods, lookin\u2019 for
    that cabin."
  - '[Jimmy stands, dusting off his pants and giving a small, friendly wave]'
  - "Spooky, huh? Well, it\u2019s been real nice chattin\u2019 with ya! You\u2019re
    a great listener! It\u2019s not often I get to share these stories with anyone."
  - "I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll meet again somewhere. If ya find any haunted cabins\u2026
    maybe just steer clear of those, eh?"
  - "[He laughs and walks off, and as you blink, where Jimmy had been walking away
    is a puff of smoke, flowing softly into the wind\u2019s current]"
  - "[You notice that as your campfire goes out\u2026]"
  - '[It begins to rain]'
