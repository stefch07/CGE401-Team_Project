  dialogue:
  - '[A large, heavily built man with a weathered jacket sits at the campfire, facing
    the river] [Press Spacebar to Advance Dialogue]'
  - "Evenin\u2019. Fire\u2019s lookin\u2019 mighty warm, huh? Decided I ought to
    have a seat, and, well, I\u2019ve been wanderin\u2019 too long to pass up a good
    rest. Name\u2019s Finn."
  - '[Finn lets out a soft sigh, feeling rather cozy, and looking out into the darkness
    as if searching for something far away]'
  - "You ever heard of the Vanishing Isle? It\u2019s an old sailor\u2019s tale, y\u2019see.
    Supposedly, out on misty nights, there\u2019s an island that appears from nowhere."
  - "Beautiful, they say\u2014trees like emeralds, sands like gold dust, and a feeling
    that you\u2019ve found somethin\u2019 that doesn\u2019t belong to this world."
  - '[He chuckles softly, shaking his head]'
  - "But it ain\u2019t all beauty. The story goes that those who set foot on the
    island\u2026 they don\u2019t come back the same. Or sometimes, they don\u2019t
    come back at all."
  - "Folks say the island isn\u2019t a place you can stay; it\u2019s a test, of sorts."
  - "It shows you your heart\u2019s deepest desires, and if you\u2019re not careful,
    you\u2019ll lose yourself tryin\u2019 to chase after them."
  - '[Finn leans back, his face half-lit by the flames]'
  - There was this sailor, name of Old Marlowe. He swore he found the isle one foggy
    night after having gone there.
  - Said he anchored his ship offshore and rowed out in a dinghy.
  - "When he stepped onto the beach, though, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave.
    He saw the life he\u2019d always wanted\u2014friends, a family, riches."
  - It felt so real, he forgot about his ship, his crew, and everything else.
  - Marlowe went across the island, enjoying all of those little things his heart
    "really wanted". But, unfortunately for him...
  - "When the island disappeared with the sunrise, Marlowe was still there\u2026
    and disappeared with it, or so the legend says."
  - '[Finn stands, brushing off his jacket and tipping an imaginary hat with a sheepish
    grin]'
  - "Well, reckon I\u2019ve taken up enough of your time. Best be gettin\u2019 on
    before the mist rolls in tonight, hey? Always good to spin a yarn by a fire."
  - "You take care now, and if you find that Vanishing Isle\u2026 maybe let me know
    what it\u2019s really like. I\u2019d like to know if Marlowe is still there\u2026"
  - "[As Finn walks away, from his back pocket, a small book drops out onto the ground\u2026]"
  - "[... with the title \u201CStories You Can Tell People if You\u2019ve Never Been
    Out to Sea\u201D. A bookmark sits in a chapter called \u201CThe Vanishing Isle\u201D]"
  - "[As you read the chapter, you realize there was an inconsistency with the way
    Finn told the story\u2026]"
  - "[You read the final lines of the chapter\u2026 Which says that Marlowe never
    made it back to tell the story of the isle]"
  - '[So how could Marlowe have told this story if he got back, like Finn said he
    did, yet disappeared when the island did too?]'
  - "[Strange. You\u2019ll have to ask Finn the next time you see him\u2026]"
