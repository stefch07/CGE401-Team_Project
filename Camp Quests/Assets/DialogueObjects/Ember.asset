  dialogue:
  - '[As the campfire crackles, a warm glow suddenly deepens around the flames] [Press
    Spacebar to Advance Dialogue]'
  - "[Out of the corner of your eye, a figure slowly appears \u2013 a woman cloaked
    in a dark shawl, with eyes that seem to hold the very flicker of fire]"
  - "Well now, what have we here? Looks like you\u2019ve got quite the blaze going."
  - '[Ember settles by the fire, gazing into it as if she can see something beyond
    the flames.]'
  - Have you heard many stories of spirits? They say that they live here, in all
    things.
  - "They\u2019re a peculiar sort, wild and free, dancing from one thing to the next,
    and always disappearing just before dawn."
  - "Fire spirits, for example, seem to show up whenever there\u2019s a bright fire."
  - '[Ember leans closer to you]'
  - Once, not far from here, a traveler was passing through.
  - "They built a campfire, just like the one you\u2019ve got, and as the night grew
    colder, they started to hear a faint voice from the flames \u2013 calling their
    name."
  - It grew louder, and finally, a figure appeared beside them, barely visible, just
    a shimmer in the firelight.
  - "They say that it was one of those fire spirits, and it had a warning to share\u2026
    A warning about never letting the fire die out before dawn."
  - '[Ember draws back slightly, her face a blend of shadows and light as she lowers
    her voice]'
  - That traveler, curious as they were, let the fire die down bit by bit to see
    what would happen.
  - Just as the last ember faded, the forest went silent. Not a single bird, nor
    breath of wind.
  - "Then, out of nowhere, an icy chill swept over the clearing, like something had
    slipped into the dark where the fire used to be. From then on\u2026 "
  - "\u2026 no one ever saw that traveler again."
  - "They say that\u2019s what happens when you forget the power of fire."
  - Spirits live in these woods, bound to their fires and bound to their secrets,
    and some things?
  - Well, some things should never be left in the dark.
  - '[She rises slowly, her figure beginning to fade as she steps back from the fire]'
  - "Thank you for sharing your fire with me\u2026 Take care of it. You never know
    when you\u2019ll need it."
  - '[As she steps back from the fire, she seems to fade away into the night, leaving
    a wisp of smoke drifting up from the embers]'
